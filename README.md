# StoryApp

In this app, we wish to achieve a goal of making it a story mode app, in which you can make one of [two] given choices or paths, and then are given [two] additional choices based on the original one you made, and so on. This sequence will go on for a said amount of time specified within the app, which will continue until a final path selection is made and the story ends.
