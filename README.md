# StoryApp

In this app, we wish to achieve a goal of making it a sotry mode app, in which you can make one of [two] given choices, and then are given [two] additional choices based on the original one you made, and so on. This sequence will go on for a said amount of times specified within the app. 

We would start off with three 2-3 choices on the main screen, which would allow you to choose which 'path' you would like to go down. Upon each choice, there will be 2 more choices within it. This will continue until a final path selection is made, and the story ends.
